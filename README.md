angular-one
===========
Hi All,

This is my first angular application which I have built after watching the eggly series on Angular development.

This is a single page application which lets you add/modify/delete/view bookmarks. It is working completely on the client side and the changes you make on the bookmarks won't persist if you re-run the application.
